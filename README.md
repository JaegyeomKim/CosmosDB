Why Choose One Over the Other?
Why Choose Cosmos DB:

Global Applications: Ideal for applications requiring low latency and high availability across multiple regions.
Multi-Model Needs: Suitable for scenarios needing different data models (e.g., documents, key-value, graph) within the same service.
Scalability: Great for applications with unpredictable or high throughput needs, offering seamless scaling.
Flexibility in Consistency: Beneficial for applications needing flexible consistency levels to balance performance and consistency.
Why Choose SQL Database:

Relational Data Needs: Best for applications needing complex querying, transactions, and structured data storage.
Legacy Applications: Ideal for existing applications already using SQL Server or requiring SQL Server features.
Business Applications: Suitable for traditional business applications, data warehousing, and reporting that rely on relational database structures.
ACID Compliance: Essential for applications requiring strict ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.
How They Work
Cosmos DB:

Data Storage: Data is stored in containers, which can be distributed globally.
Partitioning: Automatically partitions data across multiple nodes.
APIs: Supports multiple APIs for different data models, allowing flexibility in application design.
Consistency Models: Offers tunable consistency levels to optimize for performance or data accuracy.
SQL Database:

Data Storage: Data is stored in databases with tables, rows, and columns.
Schema: Requires a predefined schema and supports rich relational features like foreign keys, stored procedures, and views.
Transaction Management: Supports complex transactions with full ACID compliance.
Scalability: Uses performance tiers and can be scaled using read replicas or sharding techniques.
Resulting Implications
Cosmos DB:

Performance: Ensures high performance with low-latency operations globally.
Flexibility: Offers flexibility in data modeling and consistency settings.
Management: Simplifies global distribution and scaling, reducing the operational burden.
Cost: Can be cost-effective for highly distributed, high-throughput applications but might be more expensive for smaller, less distributed applications.
SQL Database:

Performance: Provides robust performance for relational workloads, with optimization features available.
Complexity: Requires more management for schema design and indexing but offers rich relational capabilities.
Compatibility: Maintains compatibility with existing SQL Server tools and applications.
Cost: Typically cost-effective for traditional relational database needs but may require higher tiers for large-scale or high-performance needs.
